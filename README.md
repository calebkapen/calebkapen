🤖 FTC Team: 13847 At Least It Didn't Explode

☕ Programming background:

I started learning Java around 7th grade. I programmed inactively at a beginner's level from then to 2021, when I became more interested in programming through FTC and my AP Computer Science A class.
- In Java, I am proficient in using basic tools such as arrays, loops, conditionals, methods, and classes.

✈️ I am looking to expand my programming repertoire by advancing my knowledge of Java and also with other languages.

🐍 I briefly started learning Python in late 2021, though I put it on the backburner to focus on other personal projects.
- In Python, I am able to work with basic lists, loops, conditionals, and functions.
